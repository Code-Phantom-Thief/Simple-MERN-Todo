# Simple-MERN-Todo

This is the simple MERN TodoList.

### NPM Packages:  

FrontEnd: React / React-Toastify / React Router Dom V6 / Axios / React-Helmet

BackEnd: Node.js / Express / JsonWebToken / Bcrypt / Cors / Joi / Http-Errors / Helmet / Morgan / DotEnv / Nodemon


### App Info:  

You can signup / login.

If you login successfully, you can create / update / delete Todo Lists. (If you login failure, you can watch error messages by React-Toastify)

This is very simple site.

But, this site's have all CRUD / Authentication / Authorization function .


### Warning:

1: Authentication and Authorization

This site's have not perfect authentication and authorization function.

Because, I have a limited knowledge of authentication and authorization at the present time.


2: Some Css mistakes

I knew some CSS mistakes after deploy. 

Probably, I will fix this mistakes in the future.


3: Some Error messages does not apper.


I knew this mistakes after deploy also.

For example, if you enter more than 30 characters in title area, error messages will not show.

Probably, I will fix this mistakes in the future also.


### Future Assignment:

I read some article about danger of JsonWebToken with using LocalStorage.

I knew it, and I would like to create Signup / Login form with getAccssToken / refreshToken with HttpOnlyCookie in the future. 

But, authentication process is very complicated.

And, I don't know how to achieve it at the present time.

This is the assignment for me in the future.
